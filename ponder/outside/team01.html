        <h1>Ponder: Team Activity</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will aid you in getting the project and environment
          setup for your team. It will introduce a NodeJs based workflow and
          development/build tools.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be very helpful if you have completed the Sitepoint course on

                  The driver for this week should then log into Github, and
                  visit this
                  <a href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside"
                    >repository</a
                  >
                  for the project. Click on the "Use this template" button to
                  create a copy of the base project code in a new repository
                  then give the new repo a name.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should then goto Settings->Manage Access and add
                  the rest of the team members as collaborators. (Each team
                  member needs to have their own Github account for this step.
                  Create one if you do not have one.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should then clone the repository to
                  their computer.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Finish the project setup:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Each member of the team should then open a terminal window and
                  switch to the project directory (If you are using VS Code and
                  open the folder as the current project and type
                  <kbd>ctrl ~</kbd> the terminal window will automatically be
                  set to the right directory.) then type <kbd>npm install</kbd>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This project comes with several tools built in to help the
                  team to write error free consistent code. The driver should
                  open up the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file. There are two
                  sections initially you should review.
                  <code>devDependencies</code>, and <code>scripts</code>.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>devDependencies</code> contains all of the tools we
                      will be using in our development for this project. When
                      you ran <kbd>npm install</kbd> earlier, it referred to
                      this list to know what to install.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>scripts</code> are shortcuts to commands we can run
                      to manage the project. It contains the following:
                      <pre><code class="lang-json">"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel src/index.html src/cart.html src/product_pages/*.html -d build/",
    "build": "parcel build src/index.html src/cart.html src/product_pages/*.html",
    "lint": "eslint *.js src/**/*.js",
    "format": "prettier --ignore-path ./.gitignore --write \"./**/*.{html,json,js,ts,css}\""
},</code></pre>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>start</code>: This will run our development server.
                      You will use this the most.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>build</code>: This will prepare our code to be
                      deployed to production. One person in your group should be
                      designated to run this as needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>lint</code>: This will run Eslint against the code
                      to look for style and syntax errors. You should do this
                      each time you are ready to commit. Make sure to clean up
                      any errors it finds before you commit!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>format</code>: This will run Prettier on your code
                      and format it all consistently. You should also do this as
                      a step in your commit process.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The commands are run in the terminal. If you wanted to start
                  up the development server for example you would type
                  <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. If you wanted to lint your code:
                  <kbd>npm run lint</kbd> Feel free to run each to see what it
                  does.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should run <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. This will
                  create a directory called <kbd>dist</kbd>. Commit those
                  changes and push them to Github. Then go back to the
                  repository at <kbd>github.com</kbd> and go to settings. Scroll
                  down the page until you see the section for Github Pages.
                  Select <kbd>Branch: main</kbd> in the source dropdown. Leave
                  the directory at <kbd>/(root)</kbd>. Notice the URL to your
                  published site at the top of that section. Add a
                  <kbd>dist</kbd> to the end of that URL and you should see your
                  built site.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  The driver should create a file in the root of the project
                  called <kbd>team.txt</kbd> and add their name. Then commit
                  that change, and push it up to Github.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each other member of the team should pull the changes down and
                  add their names. Then commit and push.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The driver should then edit <kdb>team.txt</kdb>. Add your
                  middle initial. Then commit and push. What happened?

                      This should have resulted in an error with Git. There were
                      multiple changes made to the same file and Git doesn't
                      know which to keep! The results in a
                      <em>merge conflict</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>How can we avoid conflicts? A couple of ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        First make sure whenever you sit down to work on the
                        project you should <em>pull</em> before you do anything
                        else to make sure you get changes any of your teammates
                        have made recently.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Commit often! Small commits are less likely to result in
                        conflicts than large ones...and they are much easier to
                        fix if a conflict does occur.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Take advantage of software design techniques like
                        <a
                          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"

                        >
                        to break your code up into smaller pieces.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Finally take advantage of Git's ability to
                        <em>branch</em>. See the stretch goals for more on that.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Before you can commit the merge conflict will need to be
                  resolved. Make sure that the <kbd>teams.txt</kbd> file is
                  open. You should see some additions to the file from Git. It
                  should look something like below.

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Branching</p>
              <p>
                One of the most powerful features of Git is the ability to
                <em>branch</em> your code. Branching makes a copy of your code
                at the current point in time that you can make changes to
                without affecting any other branch! This allows an organization
                to always keep a fully working <em>production</em> version of
                their code that can be deployed at any time, and also work on
                adding features, fixing bugs, etc that often result in things
                breaking until they are done.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also use branches to reduce merge conflicts if multiple
                team members need to make changes to the same file in a
                codebase. Each team member should complete the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create a branch. Name your branch something like
                  <kbd>initials--branch_test</kbd>. (So for me the actual name
                  of the branch would be <kbd>st--branch_test</kbd>)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a file in the root of the project called
                  <kbd>yourname.txt</kbd>. Type your name in the file.
                </li>
                <li>Commit and publish (commit) your branch to Github</li>
                <li>
                  Push your commit to Github...then do a pull after the other
                  members of the team have all pushed their branches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Switch to one of the new branches in the repository. Notice
                  what happens to the listing of files in your editor when you
                  do. Switch back to your own branch. Switch back to the master
                  branch. Discuss with your team what you saw.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Throughout the semester you will be fixing bugs and adding
                  features to the SleepOutside site. When you assign a task to
                  yourself I would create a new branch to hold the work you will
                  do. Name the branch <kbd>initials--feature-name</kbd>. So if I
                  were going to work on the card dealing with the cart total not
                  calculating correctly, and my name were John Doe, I would make
                  a branch with a name something like
                  <kbd>jd--cart-calculation</kbd>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you are done with your work and you are confident
                  everything is working you should submit a pull request (see
                  below). Each week your team will be responsible to setup a
                  meeting with the instructor (project owner) where the pull
                  requests will be reviewed and merged back into the project.
                </p>
              </div>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Pull requests</p>
              <p>
                When you are done with the feature that you created a branch
                for, the new code should be merged back into the master or main
                branch. This can be done in two ways...one is by directly
                merging the working branch back into the main branch, and the
                other is through a pull request.
              </p>
              <p>
                On projects where there is only one developer, merging directly
                works fine...but when working with a team it is more common to
                work through pull requests. A pull request essentially means "My
                work is done and tested, I am ready for the code to be merged in
                with the main branch. Can someone check it out and make sure you
                don't see any issues. (So I don't break anything :)"
              </p>
              <p>
                In our case right now, the branches do not contain anything
                important that needs to be merged back into the main branch. So
                most of them can just be deleted. Have one person however submit
                a pull request for their branch so we can see what the process
                is like.
