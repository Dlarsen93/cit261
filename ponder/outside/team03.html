        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will continue the process of making our site more
          dynamic.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

        <div class="requirements">
          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team3: Dynamic product list" task...then move it to 'Doing'.
                Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team3</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team3</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Create a module</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new file <kbd>productList.js</kbd> that we will use for
                the code to generate a list of product cards in HTML from an
                array. Add a class called <kbd>ProductList</kbd>, and think
                about what methods we will need to complete this task. Export
                your class as default, and import it into <kbd>main.js</kbd>.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Read the Data</h3>
              <p>
                Our first task is to read the product data out of the
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file (our current data source). Lucky for
                us we did that same thing last week...and we created a module to
                expose that functionality. Import the
                <code>ProductData</code> module into <kbd>main.js</kbd>
                and create an instance of it.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>ProductListing class</h3>
              <p>
                Begin creating your ProductListing module by writing the code
                for the constructor. Then create an instance of your
                <code>ProductList</code> class in <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Review the
                code from the week 2 team activity if you need help remembering
                how to do this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually we will want to have more than one category of
                products, and list each out independently. In your constructor
                you should let the class know which category of products we
                want.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to make our class as flexible and reusable as possible
                let's also pass in the HTML element we want the product list to
                render to.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Render one product</h3>
              <p>
                Add a method to your productList module to generate the html to
                display one product. The method should take the product info as
                an argument, and return the HTML markup.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Output list of products</h3>
              <p>
                Add a method to output the html to display a list of products to
                the home (index.html) page. The method should take the list of
                products as an argument, and insert the HTML markup into the
                DOM. It should leverage the method written in the last step as
                well.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Remove extra products</h3>
              <p>
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> has more tents than we currently need.
                Write a method in <kbd>productList.js</kbd> that will filter our
                list of products to just the 4 we need. Use that method to show
                only those 4 tents.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team3/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
