        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will finish the process of converting our site to a
          dynamic site.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team4: Dynamic header and footer" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team4</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team4</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                We currently have several HTML pages: index, cart, a product
                page for each product, and a mostly empty checkout page. What
                modules should we create? Which pages (views) should be entirely
                generated through Javascript and which would benefit from
                loading an HTML template in?
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I would recommend having a one to one relationship with
                  views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that needs to
                  be shared between modules can be placed in a utility modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The following views are needed: productList, productDetail,
                  cart, checkout
                </li>
                <li>
                  productList and productDetail are going to be mostly dynamic,
                  so let's just generate those entirely through Javascript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  cart and checkout will have more static content on them...so
                  let's load in an html partial as a starting point, and then
                  modify as needed with Javascript.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Navigation</h3>
              <p>
                With a SPA links do not work the way they normally should.
                Normally when you click on a link it makes a request to the host
                server for a new file. We instead need to hijack that request
                and run some Javascript locally.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Cart and Checkout</h3>
              <p>
                Write a function to output the html to display a list of
                products to the home (index.html) page. The function should take
                the list of products as an argument, and insert the HTML markup
                into the DOM. It should leverage the function writted in the
                last step as well.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Product pages</h3>
              <p>
                Write a function in <kbd>main.js</kbd> that will filter our list
                of products to just the 4 we currently need. Use that function
                to show only those 4 tents.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

          </ol>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week02/solution.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
